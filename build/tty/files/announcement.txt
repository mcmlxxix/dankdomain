Moving along, now reached the Beta stage.  More work is needed, but the core
is in place and a Go Live kick-off party for Christmas looks reasonable.
I sincerely appreciate your patience and constructive feedback.

If you do encounter a catastrophic application exception error, it is
better to force a LOGOFF event using a Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z keystroke, rather
than closing your browser window.

For now, enjoy and thank you for giving it a go.
