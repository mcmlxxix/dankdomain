New announcements as missing features get implemented or tweaked:

 - real estate + security tax credits on collection checkpoint
 - dungeon event tweaks that lessens adverse event occurrences and outcomes
 - more special bonus awards when favorable deeds are accomplished
 - UI tweaks that improve tablet / touch play
 - dungeon potions are bottled consistently per call
 - temporary buff diminishes after every engagement
 - like hone, apply lower poisons to increase temporary buff
 - a blessed/cursed state does not carry over into player's new day

Happy hunting!
