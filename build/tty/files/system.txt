This fine game runs on a Red Hat Fedora Server using an Intel Atom quad core
mini with 4gb RAM on a 100mb fiber optic internet service.

The game has been reimagined using Node.js and TypeScript.
The portal door uses the latest xterm.js with a node-pty implementation.
The telnet service allows for classic old school gaming experience.
