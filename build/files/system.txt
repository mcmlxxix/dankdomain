This game runs on a Red Hat Fedora Server using only an Intel Atom quad core
mini with 4gb RAM on a 100mb fiber optic internet service.

The game was re-imagined using Node.js and the TypeScript transpiler.
The portal door uses the latest xterm.js with a node-pty implementation.
The telnet service allows for a classic, "old school" gaming experience.
