Reminder that this is still in an alpha development stage with an aggressive
timeline to get it to beta by Christmas.  I appreciate your patience and
constructive feedback.

If (when) you encounter a catastrophic application exception error, it is
better to force a LOGOFF event using a Ctrl-D or Ctrl-Z keystroke, rather
than closing your browser window.

For now, enjoy and thank you for giving it a go.
