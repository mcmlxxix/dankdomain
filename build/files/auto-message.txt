ðŸ‘‘  NOTE
    Players stop visiting from time-to-time, bravo, we all have life
    matters to attend.  :)

As a way to help the integrity for the "active" board, an idle player
automatically downgrades to XP level 1 and appears dimmer in listings.

Still active for all other engagements and "points", but not in XP awarding.
An idle player can regain their normal status and resume play on their next
login, without loss of their current character class Level.
