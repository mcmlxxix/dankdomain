New announcements as missing features get implemented or tweaked:

 - dungeon potions are bottled consistently per call
 - UI tweaks may improve tablet / touch play
 - temporary buff diminishes after every engagement
 - like hone, apply lower poisons to increase temporary buff
 - a harmless will-o-wisp may avenge
 - a blessed/cursed state does not carry over into player's new day
 - you lose favor for killing our barkeep
 - added Psionic class: 8 dungeon monsters updated

Happy hunting!
