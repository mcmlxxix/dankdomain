PLEASE NOTE: Players will stop visiting from time-to-time, bravo, we all
have life matters to attend.  :)
So to help with integrity for the "active" board, an idle player will
automatically downgrade to XP level 1 and appear dimmer in listings.
Still active for all other engagements and "points", but not in XP awarding.
An idle player can regain their normal status and resume play on their next
login without loss of their current character class Level.

New announcements as missing features get implemented or tweaked:
- it is again possible to bump into another player in the Square
- <L>ist of Deeds include top 'Levels Jumped' and Tavern brawlers
- the Craps table is open
- major updates to both browser and door components, so update your browser!
- minor dungeon monster spawning, and your teleports will avoid the caverns
- if you fail to reroll as an immortal, you must choose a different class
- your level and charisma determines your table betting limits in the casino

Happy hunting!
