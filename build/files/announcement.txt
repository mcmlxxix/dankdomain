New announcements as missing features get implemented or tweaked:

 - more evenly distributed monsters for dungeon levels 50+
 - reorganized materials
 - Auto Message, Main Menu border, and Tavern arguments
 - added medals for gamification
 - bumping into a character in the square is subject to any material loss

Happy hunting!
