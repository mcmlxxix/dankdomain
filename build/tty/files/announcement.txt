The official 'Go Live' party starts:
    Friday, December 22nd at 12:00am midnight

I am promoting the game locally here in Providence, at my brother's store,
RAH-CoCo's Collectibles with a magnetic Dank Domain promo card advertising
this web portal. Perhaps some new players will get online and we can exploit
the fresh meat. @play(thief) Moohahahahahaha-ha!

New announcements as missing features get implemented or tweaked:
- Deterministic spellcasting is more proportionate to level and adeptness
- Dungeon monster set was revisited -- new surprises?
- Dungeon Cleric is an active NPC -- may offer Heal or Cure spell

Happy holidays and happy hunting!
