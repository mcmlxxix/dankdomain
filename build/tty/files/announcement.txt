The game's core is stable although not entirely feature complete.  That said,
I am satisfied enough to schedule a 'Dress Rehearsal' for this Friday at
12:00am midnight.

That means the game will reset, but for some fun, every player will start as
a Paladin with 4 extra random Key hints (+1 should you roll).  This rehearsal
will last for only one week -- as the official 'Go Live' party will occur on
Friday, December 22nd at 12:00am midnight.

I am also promoting the game locally here in Providence, at my brother's
store, RAH-CoCo's Collectibles with a magenetic Dank Domain promo card
advertising this web portal.  Maybe some new players will get online and we
can exploit the fresh meat. @play(thief) Moohahahahahaha-ha! 

Thank you for enduring the rapid-fire chain of events throughout the game's
development process.  Happy holidays!
