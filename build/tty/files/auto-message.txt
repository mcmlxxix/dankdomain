ðŸ‘‘ NOTE: Players will stop visiting from time-to-time, bravo, we all
have life matters to attend.  :)

So to help with integrity for the "active" board, an idle player will
automatically downgrade to XP level 1 and appear dimmer in listings.

Still active for all other engagements and "points", but not in XP awarding.
An idle player can regain their normal status and resume play on their next
login without loss of their current character class Level.
