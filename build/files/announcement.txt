Dungeon spawning now takes better account of room type size to hold its
denizens, i.e., expect to see less rooms filled with multiple oversized
monsters, such as 2 dragons.  That said, there are smaller monsters that
occupy less space, such as a goblin (1/2), ghost (1/4), or will-o-wisp (1/10).

Happy hunting!
